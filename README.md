# Animal Shelter Trends in the United States
This purpose of this research is to investigate the factors that affect the animals in animal shelters in the United States.  This study looks at which factors may affect the length of stay, the most likely outcome of each animal, the likelihood of euthanasia and the adoptability of an animal.  Initially this study focuses on dogs only, but will be added to in order to include cats. Similar studies have been done but focused on either cats or dogs in the shelter, not both animals.  The main objective of this study is to use data from several shelters for both dogs and cats in hopes of assisting with determining the factors that most heavily impact the save-rate of animals entering a shelter. Regression, classification methods, decision trees and random forests are used in this study. I found that decision trees and random forests provided the best results for these data.
